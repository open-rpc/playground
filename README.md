# OpenRPC Playground

A place to play around with OpenRPC.

[![Dependabot Status](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=open-rpc/playground)](https://dependabot.com)

## For Non-developers
This is a tool for editing, validating and previewing [OpenRPC documents](https://github.com/open-rpc/spec#openrpc-document).

## What is it?
This is meant to be an all-in-one developer portal for [OpenRPC documents](https://github.com/open-rpc/spec#openrpc-document). It includes an editor and a live-preview of the documentation.

This helps developers visualize the OpenRPC and iterate very quickly on creating [OpenRPC documents](https://github.com/open-rpc/spec#openrpc-document) via the built in editor tooling.

## Usage

Navigate to [playground.open-rpc.org](https://playground.open-rpc.org/) and start playing around. You can build your own OpenRPC document, validate existing documents quickly, or use the [examples](https://github.com/open-rpc/examples).
